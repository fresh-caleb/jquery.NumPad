# jQuery.NumPad
Flexible touch-optimized numeric keypad for web applications based on jQuery. One of the best things about jQuery.NumPad
is that it can easily fit into most UI frameworks using jQuery by merely setting a few templates! The numeric keypad can
be used to fill inputs, password fields, general div-elements or entire table columns.

## Demos
Demos for use with jQuery mobile and Bootstrap are included.

## Documentation
The code is clean. For now, the code and the examples are the documentation. The properties are well commented and most
of the code does not need comments.

## Quick start

1) Include the plugin and the CSS in your header

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path_to_numpad_folder/jquery.numpad.css">
<script type="text/javascript" src="path_to_numpad_folder/jquery.numpad.js"></script>
```

2) Initialize numpads for every element you want to toggle a numeric keypad

```javascript
function ($) {
  $('selector1').numpad();
}
```
